# 🧮 React Wages Calculator

A modern **Wages Calculator web app** built with **React + Vite**, designed to make employee wage calculation fast, accurate, and simple.  
This project is a React translation of my earlier vanilla JS app — rebuilt with a modular structure, reusable components, and modern tooling.
